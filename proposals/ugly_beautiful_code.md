## Description
_Detailed description. Will be made public if your talk is accepted._

If learning to code is hard, learning how to teach others to code may be even harder! Teaching Python requires a solid knowledge of the essential vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and punctuation, as well as of functions and data structures in general, but it doesn't hurt to understand a bit about the mechanics of human learning. For instance, since there's an inverse relationship between expertise and cognitive load, the more expert you become in a language, the harder it can become to explain (or to relate to the agony of learning). So what happens when a software engineer teams up with a former writing professor to teach Python to a bunch of budding data scientists? Join us to find out!

There are many features that make Python special &mdash; its compactness, modularity, and object-orientation; its rich library of [third party packages](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), and diverse, interdisciplinary community of users. And yet, delving into Python for the first time can be tough for those without prior programming experience. Even for those with previous coding skills, we frequently see in our students a tendency towards inefficient and unfocused practices &mdash; copying code from other sources (e.g. [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)) without reflecting on how or why it works; rote repetition of a singular approach merely _because_ it works; hasty, rapidfire adoption and abandonment of method after method without really unpacking the feedback provided in the error messages.

Potential blockers for people learning Python can include everything from workflow and environment challenges (code editors, CLI, pip, Git, etc), to writing habits (writer's block, awkward copy-and-pasting), to audience awareness (lack of documentation, code review fear). An understanding of the writing process (borrowed from the field of rhetoric and composition) can shed light on some of the underlying causes for these blockers, and to helpful solutions.

This talk is structured as a collegial dialogue between two Python teachers with very different backgrounds &mdash; one who went to the U.S. Naval Academy, the other who went to liberal arts school; one a computer scientist and longtime Python programmer, the other an "advanced beginner" who previously taught technical writing. Together they discuss their observations and techniques for helping young students struggling to learn Python as a first language, for mid-career professionals switching from languages like Java and SQL, and even for skeptical data scientists-in-training who doubt the relevance of programming to their work.


## Additional Notes
_Anything else you'd like the program committee to know when making their selection: your past speaking experience, open source community experience, etc._

Ben and Rebecca are adjunct faculty at Georgetown University's School of Continuing Studies in Washington, DC, where they teach in the Data Science Certificate Program, which is taught entirely in Python.

They are active contributors to the Python and open source communities, working with the team at [District Data Labs](https://districtdatalabs.com), an open source collaborative. At PyCon 2016, they had several posters, a talk, and a tutorial including [_Evolutionary Design of Particle Swarms_](http://pycon.districtdatalabs.com/posters/python-for-science/horizontal/ddl-python-for-science-horz-print.pdf), [_Visual Diagnostics for Machine Learning_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5DaaGZWQqY), and [Natural Language Processing with NLTK and Gensim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itKNpCPHq3I&feature=youtu.be). They also participated in the sprints and are planning to do so again in 2017. All PyCon 2016 materials are published and freely available (licensed by the Creative Commons) at [http://pycon.districtdatalabs.com/](http://pycon.districtdatalabs.com/). They also presented talks at both PyData Carolinas 2016 and PyData DC 2016, and would be happy to provide links to those videos as well.

The presenters are also co-authors of the forthcoming O'Reilly book, __Applied Text Analysis with Python__ and organizers for Data Community DC - a not-for-profit organization of 9 meetups that organizes free monthly events and lectures for the local data community in Washington, DC.
