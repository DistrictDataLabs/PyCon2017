algebra       = '''Algebra (from Arabic "al-jabr" meaning
                   "reunion of broken parts") is one of the
                   broad parts of mathematics, together with
                   number theory, geometry and analysis. In
                   its most general form, algebra is the study
                   of mathematical symbols and the rules for
                   manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying
                   thread of almost all of mathematics.'''

french_silk   = '''In a small saucepan, combine sugar
                   and eggs until well blended. Cook
                   over low heat, stirring constantly,
                   until mixture reaches 160° and coats
                   the back of a metal spoon. Remove
                   from the heat. Stir in chocolate and
                   vanilla until smooth. Cool to
                   lukewarm (90°), stirring occasionally.
                   In a small bowl, cream butter until
                   light and fluffy. Add cooled
                   chocolate mixture; beat on high speed
                   for 5 minutes or until light and
                   fluffy. In another large bowl, beat
                   cream until it begins to thicken. Add
                   confectioners' sugar; beat until stiff
                   peaks form. Fold into chocolate
                   mixture. Pour into crust. Chill for at
                   least 6 hours before serving. Garnish
                   with whipped cream and chocolate curls
                   if desired.'''
