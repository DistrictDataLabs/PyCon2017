## Poster Visualizations

The `poster` directory generates the figures for the Yellowbrick poster. To run, make sure that you have Yellowbrick 0.4 or later installed as well as Pandas and NLTK (with the NLTK corpora downloaded). Then run the following:

    $ python download.py
    $ python figures.py

The first script downloads the datasets and the second generates the figures. They can be found in PDF in the `figures` directory. Note that all directories are relative to the `poster` directory.
